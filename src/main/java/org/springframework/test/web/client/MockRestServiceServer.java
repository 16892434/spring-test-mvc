/**
 * <strong>Main entry point for client-side REST testing</strong>. Typically used to test a {@link RestTemplate}, set up
 * expectations on request messages, and create response messages.
 * <p/>
 * The typical usage of this class is:
 * <ol>
 * <li>Create a {@code MockRestServiceServer} instance by calling {@link #createServer(RestTemplate)}.
 * <li>Set up request expectations by calling {@link #expect(RequestMatcher)}, possibly by using the default
 * {@link RequestMatcher} implementations provided in {@link RequestMatchers} (which can be statically imported).
 * Multiple expectations can be set up by chaining {@link ResponseActions#andExpect(RequestMatcher)} calls.</li>
 * <li>Create an appropriate response message by calling {@link ResponseActions#andRespond(ResponseCreator)
 * andRespond(ResponseCreator)}, possibly by using the default {@link ResponseCreator} implementations provided in
 * {@link ResponseCreators} (which can be statically imported).</li>
 * <li>Use the {@code RestTemplate} as normal, either directly of through client code.</li>
 * <li>Call {@link #verify()}.
 * </ol>
 * Note that because of the 'fluent' API offered by this class (and related classes), you can typically use the Code
 * Completion features (i.e. ctrl-space) in your IDE to set up the mocks.
